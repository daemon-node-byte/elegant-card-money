      <p>Tarot is an ancient practice that uses a deck of 78 cards to explore life's questions, provide guidance, and foster self-reflection. Each card in the tarot deck is rich with symbolic imagery and meaning, which can offer deep insights into various aspects of life, including relationships, career, and personal growth. Tarot readings involve interpreting cards drawn in response to a specific question or situation, helping the reader to tap into their intuition and gain perspective.</p>
      <p>The deck is divided into two main sections: the Major Arcana and the Minor Arcana. The Major Arcana consists of 22 cards, each representing significant life themes and spiritual lessons, such as The Fool, The Magician, and The World. These cards often reflect major turning points or profound insights. The Minor Arcana, with 56 cards, focuses on more everyday matters and is divided into four suits: Cups, Pentacles, Swords, and Wands. Each suit represents a different realm of lifeâ€”emotions, material matters, thoughts, and actions.</p>
      <p>While tarot is often used for fortune-telling, many view it as a powerful tool for self-discovery, allowing individuals to access their inner wisdom and make thoughtful decisions. Whether you're seeking clarity, exploring possibilities, or looking for a deeper connection to yourself, tarot can serve as a valuable guide on your journey.</p>
